# GALO (Starsector)
Galo is a small star sector mod that provides a small quest and an unique encounter.

## Dependencies

- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) is recommended to compile and build (you may do it by hand)

## Build
It's suggested to clone the repository inside the `starsector/mods` folder to quickly debug.

- To build a dev version (creates mod_info and compile jar):

    ```./gradlew.bat build-dev```

- To build a distribution zip file:

    ```./gradlew.bat build-dist```
